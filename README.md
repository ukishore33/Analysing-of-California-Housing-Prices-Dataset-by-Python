# Analysis of California Housing Prices Dataset using Python

The main aim of the Project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the California Housing Dataset.

[Analysis of California Housing Prices Dataset](https://github.com/ukishore33/California-Housing-Prices-Project/blob/main/California%20Housing%20Prices%20Dataset.ipynb)

Imported various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib into Google Collab and imputed the missing values with the mean value using the fillna() function.

While plotting Median income against its frequency, it was right skewed which means there are less households with very high income, while the most of the households have very low income.

While plotting housing median age column against its frequency, some of the outliers were seen rarely, no abnormal distribution or skewness were noticed and that indicates the data is distributed equally.

There is a positive correlation between median income and median house value. This means that as the median income of a neighborhood increases, the median house value also tends to increase.
